> **NAMING NOTE (2026-05-13):** This document uses the working name "Adaptive Edge Engine." The canonical product name is now **"EdgeLab Research Studio"** with three sub-engines: Feature Discovery Engine, Regime-Adaptive Optimization Engine, and NSLM Feature Studio. This document is preserved as the original design specification.

# NeuroSpect Adaptive Edge Engine — Design Doc

## 1. Executive Summary

The **NeuroSpect Adaptive Edge Engine** is a proposed research platform inside NeuroSpect EdgeLab that turns trading outcomes into better features, better model parameters, better NSLM prompts, and stronger hybrid trading models.

It is designed to answer one core question:

> Why did this model win or lose, and what feature, parameter, regime filter, or NSLM reasoning improvement would have changed the outcome?

The engine connects three major capabilities:

1. **Edge Forensics Engine** — analyzes wins, losses, skipped trades, and breakevens to discover what market conditions and feature states caused performance outcomes.
2. **Regime Intelligence Engine** — detects market regimes and tunes feature/model parameters by regime, session, news state, liquidity state, and price cycle.
3. **NSLM Context Injection Lab** — injects structured quant, ICT, regime, and trade-context features into NSLM prompts so NSLM can generate classifications, hypotheses, feature suggestions, and parameter improvements.

The output of the system is a continuously improving **Feature Library** of validated, versioned, testable features.

This system should be treated as a **research and decision-support layer**, not a trading signal guarantee. All trading decisions, model promotions, and automated workflows should remain gated by validation, risk controls, and human review.

## 3. Core Components

## 3.1 Edge Forensics Engine

### Previous working idea

> Feature researcher — analyzes past trading model performance, gathers all data that caused a losing trade, and creates, adds, or removes features that will mitigate the loss. Same for wins.

### Formal name

## **Edge Forensics Engine**

### Description

**Edge Forensics Engine** analyzes past wins, losses, breakevens, skipped trades, and model decisions to identify the conditions that caused performance outcomes. It gathers trade context, market data, ICT events, quant features, NSLM outputs, journal notes, and model state to explain why a trade or strategy variant succeeded or failed.

It then recommends:

* new feature candidates,
* features to remove,
* feature parameter changes,
* regime-specific filters,
* prompt/model evaluation cases,
* backtest experiments,
* validation tests,
* feature library promotions or rejections.

### What it does

| Capability                  | Description                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Loss clustering             | Groups losing trades by shared conditions.                                                                   |
| Win clustering              | Finds repeated conditions behind profitable trades.                                                          |
| Feature contribution review | Identifies which features helped, hurt, or added noise.                                                      |
| Failure mode detection      | Finds common failure patterns such as weak displacement, no liquidity sweep, bad session, or news proximity. |
| Counterfactual simulation   | Tests whether a feature/filter would have avoided a loss or removed too many winners.                        |
| Feature recommendation      | Suggests new features or changes to existing features.                                                       |
| Feature removal suggestion  | Flags features that overfit, leak, conflict, or fail out-of-sample.                                          |
| Experiment generation       | Creates EdgeLab experiments from discovered patterns.                                                        |

### Concrete examples

#### Example A — Losing trade pattern

Edge Forensics detects:

* 9 losing trades occurred during New York Lunch.
* All had low displacement quality.
* Session range had already exceeded the 85th percentile.
* No SMT divergence was present.
* FVG retrace occurred late after the initial impulse.

Suggested features:

* `session_range_percentile`
* `late_fvg_retrace_penalty`
* `smt_confirmation_flag`
* `displacement_quality_score`
* `ny_lunch_chop_filter`

Suggested action:

> Run a parameter sweep requiring displacement quality above 0.72 during high-range NY Lunch conditions.

#### Example B — Winning trade pattern

Edge Forensics detects:

* The most profitable wins occurred in NY AM.
* Liquidity was swept before displacement.
* Displacement closed through short-term structure.
* FVG retrace occurred within 20 minutes.
* HTF bias matched the trade direction.

Suggested feature:

```text
nyam_sweep_displacement_fvg_alignment
```

Description:

> Detects when NY AM liquidity sweep, strong displacement, FVG retrace timing, and HTF bias alignment occur together.

---

## 3.2 Regime Intelligence Engine

### Previous working idea

> Market Regime Detector — uses and fine-tunes model parameters that increase performance by regime.

### Formal name

## **Regime Intelligence Engine**

### Description

**Regime Intelligence Engine** detects current and historical market regimes, then adapts feature thresholds, strategy parameters, model selection, risk assumptions, and NSLM context based on the regime.

The goal is not just to label the market. The goal is to answer:

> Which features and parameters work best under this specific market condition?

### Regime dimensions

| Dimension          | Example values                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Volatility regime  | low, normal, high, extreme                              |
| Trend state        | trending, mean reverting, choppy, transitional          |
| Session            | Asia, London, NY AM, NY Lunch, NY PM                    |
| Day of week        | Monday through Friday                                   |
| News state         | pre-news, during-news, post-news, no major news         |
| Liquidity state    | buy-side swept, sell-side swept, both swept, none swept |
| SMT state          | confirmed, absent, conflicting                          |
| Price cycle        | consolidation, accumulation, manipulation, distribution |
| HTF bias           | bullish, bearish, neutral, conflicting                  |
| Range state        | inside prior range, expanding range, exhausted range    |
| Displacement state | weak, moderate, strong                                  |

### What it does

| Capability                  | Description                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regime classification       | Labels historical and current market state.                                   |
| Parameter tuning            | Finds optimal feature thresholds by regime.                                   |
| Regime-specific performance | Shows which setups work or fail under each condition.                         |
| Adaptive feature weighting  | Increases/decreases feature importance by regime.                             |
| Model routing               | Recommends which model variant to use under specific regimes.                 |
| Risk adjustment             | Recommends reduced risk, no-trade, or normal risk based on tested conditions. |

### Concrete examples

#### Example A — Volatility-adjusted displacement

Default rule:

```text
displacement_score >= 0.60
```

Regime-adjusted rule:

```text
if regime = high_volatility_expansion:
  displacement_score >= 0.74
```

Reason:

> Weak displacement failed more often during high-volatility NY AM conditions.

#### Example B — News-sensitive setup filtering

Default rule:

```text
setup_quality_score >= 0.65
```

Adaptive rule:

```text
if news_proximity_minutes <= 30:
  setup_quality_score >= 0.82
```

Reason:

> Historical simulations showed lower model reliability within 30 minutes of major economic news.

#### Example C — Liquidity-state gating

Default:

```text
FVG retrace entries allowed
```

Adaptive:

```text
if liquidity_swept_flag = false:
  block_liquidity_sweep_fvg_strategy
```

Reason:

> FVG retrace strategy underperformed when no prior session liquidity was swept.

## 3.3 NSLM Context Injection Lab

### Previous working idea

> NSLM Model Injection — inject features as parameters into a prompt that can run iterations on optimal feature values and integrate with ICT concepts to create bespoke feature suggestions, then add those suggestions to the feature library.

### Formal name

## **NSLM Context Injection Lab**

### Description

**NSLM Context Injection Lab** converts structured market data, quant features, ICT events, regime labels, and historical model performance into clean prompt parameters for NSLM.

NSLM then reasons over that structured context and returns:

* setup classification,
* trade thesis quality,
* feature suggestions,
* parameter recommendations,
* ICT-aware hypotheses,
* failure explanations,
* prompt/model comparison artifacts,
* candidate features for the Feature Library.

### Core principle

```text
NSLM should reason over clean structured feature snapshots, not raw noisy market streams.
```

### What it does

| Capability                      | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature snapshot injection      | Converts market state into structured prompt context.                |
| Prompt parameter testing        | Runs NSLM with different feature sets and parameter values.          |
| NSLM output structuring         | Forces outputs into schemas that can be stored and tested.           |
| ICT hypothesis generation       | Uses ICT concepts to propose new features or rules.                  |
| Feature candidate creation      | Converts NSLM suggestions into testable feature definitions.         |
| Prompt/model version comparison | Compares NSLM prompt/model variants in EdgeLab.                      |
| Feedback loop generation        | Turns failures into future evaluation cases or fine-tuning examples. |

## 7.2 Detailed E2E Example: Losing Trade to New Feature

### Step 1 — Losing trade occurs

Example:

| Field   | Value                                               |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Symbol  | NQ                                                  |
| Session | New York AM                                         |
| Setup   | Buy-side sweep → bearish displacement → FVG retrace |
| Result  | Loss                                                |
| PnL     | -$620                                               |
| Outcome | Stop hit before continuation                        |

---

### Step 2 — Snapshot reconstruction

The system reconstructs what was known at the time:

```json
{
  "symbol": "NQ",
  "timeframe": "5m",
  "eventTimestamp": "2026-02-12T15:05:00Z",
  "session": "New York AM",
  "setupCandidate": "buy_side_sweep_bearish_displacement_fvg_retrace",
  "features": {
    "mean_price_5m": 17942.25,
    "realized_volatility_5m": 0.86,
    "session_range_percentile": 92,
    "displacement_score": 0.58,
    "fvg_proximity_ticks": 18,
    "liquidity_swept_flag": true,
    "smt_divergence_flag": false,
    "news_proximity_minutes": 18,
    "htf_bias_alignment": "bearish",
    "price_cycle_phase": "manipulation"
  }
}
```

---

### Step 3 — Edge Forensics analysis

Findings:

* Displacement score was below the historical profitable threshold.
* Session range was already extended.
* News was too close.
* SMT confirmation was absent.
* Similar losses clustered around late retraces after aggressive range expansion.

---

### Step 4 — Regime Intelligence analysis

Detected regime:

```text
high_volatility_news_sensitive_nyam_expansion
```

Regime recommendation:

```text
Raise displacement threshold from 0.60 to 0.74 when:
- session = NY AM
- session_range_percentile > 85
- news_proximity_minutes < 30
```

---

### Step 5 — NSLM Context Injection

The system sends a structured prompt context into NSLM.

```json

  "task": "feature_research",
  "model": "NSLM",
  "promptVersion": "feature-suggestion-v3",
  "marketContext": {

    "news_proximity_minutes": 18
  },
  "ictContext": {
    "htfBias": "bearish",
    "liquidityEvent": "buy_side_sweep",

    "lossCluster": "late_fvg_retrace_after_extended_session_range",
    "similarLosses": 7,
    "similarWins": 2
  }
}
```

      "type": "confluence_feature",
      "description": "Flags setups where SMT confirmation is absent in regimes where SMT historically improved filtering.",

### Step 7 — Feature Library candidates created

| Feature                                | Type               | Status | Source                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------ | -------------------------- |
| `news_adjusted_displacement_threshold` | Adaptive threshold | Draft  | NSLM + Edge Forensics      |

## 8. Example NSLM Model Injection

## 8.1 NSLM Injection Prompt Template

```text
You are NSLM, NeuroSpect's ICT-aware trading research model.

Your task is to analyze the provided feature snapshot, ICT context, trade outcome, and regime context.

Return only structured JSON.

Goals:
1. Explain why the trade likely won, lost, or should have been skipped.
2. Identify missing features that could improve future filtering.
3. Recommend parameter sweeps.
4. Suggest whether any existing features should be removed or down-weighted.
5. Create feature candidates that can be tested in EdgeLab.

Constraints:
- Do not give financial advice.
- Do not claim certainty.
- Do not recommend live trading.
- Focus on testable research hypotheses.
- Every feature suggestion must include a reason and validation test.
```

## 13. Research Safety and Validation Rules

This system must enforce strong research controls.

### Key risks

| Risk                     | Description                                           | Mitigation                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lookahead bias           | Feature uses information not available at trade time. | Event-time snapshots and availability timestamps.       |
| Data leakage             | Future outcome leaks into feature generation.         | Leakage audits and train/test separation.               |
| Overfitting              | Feature only works on narrow historical windows.      | Walk-forward, Monte Carlo, out-of-sample tests.         |
| Prompt overfitting       | NSLM prompt tuned too specifically to past trades.    | Prompt version holdout sets.                            |
| Regime over-optimization | Parameter works only in one narrow regime.            | Minimum sample thresholds and stability scoring.        |
| NSLM hallucination       | NSLM invents unsupported explanations.                | Structured outputs, source grounding, evaluator checks. |
| False feature confidence | Feature looks useful but lacks robust validation.     | Promotion gates and human approval.                     |
| Excessive complexity     | Too many features make model fragile.                 | Complexity penalty and feature pruning.                 |
